            p Leaderboards have been removed.

            p Cheating and XSS are okay. I, as a developer, learned a lot from this, so thank you to whoever cheated and took advantage of my poor sanitization!

            p What's not okay is racism and discriminatory comments in the username field. I know that it is easy to handle and prevent this. But at the end I just decided to remove high scores.

            p The leaderboards took away my focus from the main typing game.

            p
                b Thank you to whoever participated.
